				<h2>Fablab Safety</h2>
				<p>First lesson of digital fabrication, we were taught the rules and reglations of for Fablab especially the Lab where most of the practical work is going on. Safety measures had been enforced due to many passed accidents, that is very serious. And getting know of how we should dress our movements and tape floor is to tell me when one is using the machine the others should stay behind the boundary line.</P>
				<p><b>Basic rules</b>
				<p>1) First thing first for boys and girls hair must be neat and secured properly at all times, to prevent hazard for the machine and yourself (e.g hair getting stuck, got burn or tangled)</p>
				<p>2) Secondly wearing proper clothing like non baggy shirt and shirt that is not too long that will casue hazard.</p>
				<p>3) Thirdly you are required to wear long pants/jeans when they are using equipment in the Fablab, this prevents flying object from hitting the leg like small equipments or parts, that the long pants is able to be a layer of protection.</p>
				<p>4) Lastly wear covered shoes to prevent objects dropping and striking your leg.</p>
